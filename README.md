HOW TO PLAY:

The game will open with a title screen. Click the button telling you to start the game.

The game will then prompt you with a texfield and the name "John Doe". Enter your name into the text field or keep the template name and hit the accept button (YOU MUST HAVE A NAME IN THE TEXTFIELD IN ORDER TO PROCEED).

The game's trivia questions are split into four categories (Buisness Tech, Coding, Gaming, and Hardware). Select one of the four categories to begin. Each category contains a total of 10 questions. If you answer any of the questions with an incorrect answer, the game will deduct one life point from you and send you back to the categories page (you can reselect the same category you previously chose). If you answer a question with the correct answer, the game will move on to the next question until you have completed the category (completed categories can not be chosen again)

LOSING CONDITION:
  Answering 3 questions incorrectly.

WINNING CONDITION:
  Answers all questions from all 4 categories correctly (2 mistakes are tolerated).
